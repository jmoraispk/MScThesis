abstract = {Recent developments in key technologies like 5G, Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) and Tactile Internet result in new possibilities for communication. Particularly, these key digital technologies can enable remote communication and collaboration in remote experiences. In this demo, we work towards 6-degrees of freedom (DoF) photo-realistic shared experiences by introducing a multi-view multi-sensor capture end-to-end system. Our system acts as a baseline end-to-end system for capture, transmission and rendering of volumetric video of user representations. To handle multi-view video processing in a scalable way, we introduce a Multi-point Control Unit (MCU) to shift processing from end devices into the cloud. MCUs are commonly used to bridge videoconferencing connections, and we design and deploy a VR-ready MCU to reduce both upload bandwidth and end-device processing requirements. In our demo, we focus on a remote meeting use case where multiple people can sit around a table to communicate in a shared VR environment.},

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) and 360-degree video are set to become part of the future social environment, enriching and enhancing the way we share experiences and collaborate remotely. While Social VR applications are getting more momentum, most services regarding Social VR focus on animated avatars. In this demo, we present our efforts towards Social VR services based on photo-realistic video recordings. In this demo paper, we focus on two parts, the communication between multiple people (max 3) and the integration of new media formats to represent users as 3D point clouds. We enhance a green screen (chroma key) like cut-out of the person with depth data, allowing point cloud based rendering in the client. Further, the paper presents a user study with 54 people evaluating a three-people communication use case and a technical analysis to move towards 3D representations of users. This demo consists of two shared virtual environments to communicate and interact with others, i.e. i) a 360-degree virtual space with users being represented as 2D video streams (with the background removed) and ii) a 3D space with users being represented as point clouds (based on color and depth video data).},
