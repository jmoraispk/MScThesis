\section{Radio Resource Management}
\label{sec:rrm}

The process of \ac{RRM} accommodates many mechanisms and components. This section is dedicated to review what those are.

The main components required for deciding which resources should be assigned to which transmission are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User scheduler
    \item SINR aggregation across PRBs
\end{itemize}



% Update scheduling information....
Some authors consider updating the scheduling information every two TTIs \cite{7986957}, to match LTE. Other authors \cite{dmimo-remco} prefer updating as frequently as possible. 



\subsection*{scheduler}

provided that our traffic is all real-time traffic from the application, and given that our application is very latency-constrained, \cite{7020879} advises the use of a latency aware scheduler and shows that \ac{M-LWDF} performs slightly better than \ac{EXP/PF}. Nonetheless, the classic \ac{PF} scheduler and the two mentioned before are good options.
