\section{Social XR Applications}
\label{sec:sxr_applications}

% what can the reader expect and what is the importance of this section?

This section provides background about the application use-case/service we intend to support. It is relevant for the remaining of this work since several of its aspects influence the propagation channel. Additionally, radio resource management aims to fulfil application traffic, therefore the traffic characteristics are of importance as well.

The service whose provision we aim to support, and eventually optimise, is social XR conferences. More specifically, first and foremost, we need to find what are the application requirements in terms of throughput and latency. Then, we survey literature for \ac{UL} and \ac{DL} application traffic models, like a random packet arrival distribution.

Furthermore, we require a model for user behaviour in terms of movement since user mobility influences the propagation conditions and radio channel variability, which are important factors to take into account during radio resource management procedures. And finally, it is useful to review attempts from other authors to optimise \ac{QoS} provision over wireless for XR applications.

Let us start by clarifying the term \ac{XR}. By definition, it refers to all real-and-virtual combined environments and human-machine interactions generated by computer technology and wearables. In essence, it includes \ac{AR}, \ac{VR} and everything in between. Movies such as ``Ready Player One'' \cite{readyPlayerOne} anticipate what can be the future of these technologies; see Figure \ref{fig:kingsman_ar} for a snapshot of an AR meeting use-case taken from a movie.

Regarding the state of the art in XR applications optimisation from the wireless perspective, the research topic has not been very active. There is no lack of reasons to research how to remove the wire that connects the \ac{HMD} to the network, such as improving the immersiveness of experience and reducing the risk of tripping hazards. But there has not been much attention from the wireless communications research community, with the vast majority of well-cited papers dating no later than 2017 \cite{9112752}.

\subsection*{Requirements}

Fortunately, with respect to requirements there has been plenty of speculation. Elbamby \ii{et al.} \cite{Elbamby_towards_low_latency_vr} does a back-of-the-envelope calculation. He considers that each human is able to see up to 64 million pixels (having 150\tdeg horizontal and 120\tdeg vertical \ac{FOV}, and resolution of 60 pixels per degree), at 120 \ac{FPS} (required to generate a real-like view), thus resulting in up to 15.5 billion pixels per second of raw information. He concludes that even compressing the stream by 600 times with a state-of-the-art H.265 encoder, it requires 1 Gbps (gigabit per second) speeds to transmit if each coloured pixel (provided that is stored with a high resolution of 36 bits). Other authors \cite{bastug_towards_interconnected_vr} reach even higher numbers.

Of course, as a back of the envelope calculation it has its utility, but some important factors are missing. Namely, there exist many application-layer techniques to reduce the required bitrate, e.g. frame prediction in applications where 360\tdeg video is involved \cite{frame_prediction}. Also, 64 million pixels per eye equates to almost double the pixel count of an 8K screen (7680 by 4320 pixels). Therefore very high-end conditions are far from realistic in the near future. The current best display achieves 1700 by 1440 pixels per eye, which is less than 2K, with a refresh rate of 90 Hz \cite{vive_cosmos_elite}. Any display advertising higher numbers uses pixel interpolation \cite{pimax} which hurts quality.

The throughput estimation can also be higher. \ac{HEVC}, or H.265, is a complex set of algorithms that, as the name suggest, aims to optimise coding efficiency, i.e. to reduce the data as much as possible while keeping the quality imperceptible unchanged. These complex algorithms take many tens or even hundreds of milliseconds to encode, making them less suitable for real-time transmissions. Within the standard there are options that achieve lower encoding and decoding latencies, but at expense of compression ratio.

In summary, the application resolutions and frame rates differ considerably, and it is yet unknown what would constitute good \ac{QoE}. Since \cite{Elbamby_towards_low_latency_vr} and \cite{vr_on_the_edge} agree an entry-level VR would need around 100 Mbps, and considering \ac{3GPP} \cite{3GPP_xr} 50-100 Mbps estimate (for the most common streaming strategy) and \cite{bastug_towards_interconnected_vr} proposal of 100-200 Mbps, we may settle for 100 Mbps of throughput requirements for the near-future VR experience, in order to establish a concrete first target for near-future VR.

To finalise the required throughputs requirements a streaming strategy needs to be defined and 3GPP \cite{3GPP_xr} defines mainly two, viewport-independent (most common) and viewport-dependent streaming. The difference lies preparing the scene to send to a user independently of the user thus sending the full XR scene, or based on what the user is looking at, respectively. When the user point of view is considered, only the data that user requires can be sent, which should allow for a reduction in the required bitrate by a factor of two to four compared to sending the full XR scene. 


Regarding latencies, the distinction between two latencies should be made. There is the \ac{RTT} latency and there is the \ac{MTP} latency. The latter is basically an headset requirement: from the time a movement occurs to the changes be reflected in the display there must not go more than 20 ms \cite{3GPP_xr, Elbamby_towards_low_latency_vr}. The first, on the other hand, is on the order of several tens or hundreds of milliseconds and is the time it takes for the information to go from the user to the main XR server and an answer to come back to the user. %This is the latency we are interested in and consists of several components, as shown in Figure .%ref to figure

%\todo[inline]{include figure for several delays in the end-to-end chain}

Two-way delay contributions include, sensor sampling, encoding, one-way network delay (router and access point processing delays, queuing delays, transmission delays and propagation delays), decoding, image processing algorithms on the cloud, encoding once again, another one-way network delay, decoding, local frame rendering and display refresh delay. Most of these delays are practically imperceptible compared to others. For instance, the delay from sensor sampling is less than 1 ms while the display delay tends to be 10-15 ms \cite{bastug_towards_interconnected_vr} although it is expected to drop to less than 5 ms \cite{vr_on_the_edge}. 

Additionally, currently just the computation delay alone exceeds 100 ms \cite{vr_on_the_edge}. However, by making a smart use of caching, bringing the processing power closer to the access (edge computing) and improving of communications \cite{Elbamby_towards_low_latency_vr, bastug_towards_interconnected_vr, 3GPP_xr} this delay is foreseen to drop to below 10 ms \cite{vr_on_the_edge}. 

The target for \ac{RTT} of 50 ms is given by \cite{3GPP_xr}. \cite{vr_on_the_edge} says 30 ms is a better value. Also, 3GPP defines in \cite{3GPP_xr} a \ac{5GI} of value 82 for \ac{AR} applications mapping to \ac{QoS} characteristics of 10 ms radio interface latency and $10^{-6}$ \ac{PER}. Thus, we conclude that 10ms is an hard upper limit of accepted latency, and that the preference is to as low as possible.

\subsection*{Architecture and Capture System}

The standardisation of architecture of the network for XR conference applications by 3GPP \cite{3GPP_xr} is in agreement with \cite{multi_sensor_tno}. Remarks relevant to our study lie in terms of traffic patterns and relationships between uplink and downlink. Figure \ref{fig:xr_setting} shows the simplified capture system and relevant architecture details. 

\image{Literature Review/xr_setting.png}{Simplified architecture and capture system for XR conference}{fig:xr_setting}{.46}

There is a single uplink stream per user for pre-transmission stream synchronisation. Therefore, the information captured from both cameras is aggregated into one single stream before transmitted, which facilitates the synchronisation in the cloud. This aggregation should happen as close to the source as possible to avoid having the destination wait to receive both recordings of the same user with the same timestamps. Such loss of synchrony can happen when each camera sends its information separately due to the delays of different paths in the network.

Furthermore, at this stage, the information recorded constitutes the user perspectives. Although user perspectives recorded from different cameras can be aggregated into a 3D user representation making it more compact compared to simply stitching camera streams, this is infeasible in the near future due to latency constraints - the processing time required is very long. Therefore, each participant receives the information of each other participant, which is the information recorded by two (or more) capture devices, in case of viewport-independent streaming. With viewport-dependent streaming the users receive only the users they are looking at. Also, in case of an \ac{AR} meeting, the users only receive information on the remote (non-physically present) users, since the physically present users can be seen through the AR glasses. 

With respect to how the capture should be made, \cite{double_rgb_tno} tests and proposes a dual-camera setup where each camera can record \ac{RGB} and depth information. The cameras should be placed at head height, roughly 30\tdeg from the normal to the user. Exactly how information is stored and transmitted, being double RGBD (RGB plus depth) or 3D mesh or as a point cloud, is yet to be determined, despite playing an important role in the throughput and latency requirements \cite{3GPP_xr}.


\subsection*{Model for Human Head Movement and Traffic}

To the best of our knowledge, there are no human head movement models in literature that suit a conference. Some authors have recorded head and eye movement for different scenarios of 360\tdeg video \cite{avtrack360, dataset2}. However, not only does 360\tdeg video have a considerably different dynamic than a real-time conference, but none of the videos were remotely close to a meeting room.

Likewise, we did not find traces in literature of XR conferences traffic models. Traffic models on its own are relatively hard to find, and it has proven to be an impossible task for such a new application. After all, there still is no agreement \cite{3GPP_xr, multi_sensor_tno} in many important details of the application


\subsection*{Different Optimisation Approaches}

In \cite{8395443} is presented a framework that analyses the performance of VR services over wireless networks. The framework captures the tracking accuracy, transmission delay, and processing delay, but most radio characteristics such as frequency-selective fading (signal oscillations), antenna configurations and blockage effects are not considered. The authors of \cite{cutting_the_cord} study the impact of blockage by hand, head and body on wireless \ac{mmWave} links, and suggest an algorithm to overcome the corresponding challenges. The proposed solution uses a fixed relay to increase robustness against blocking and is assessed in an experimental setup. The attainable gains strongly depend on numerous assumptions and deployment configurations which are not described in any detail. 


Other more common approach to the problem of optimising VR meetings provision taken by other authors \cite{7997740, 8319985} is to focus on the network perspective, and disregards the radio interface. One may conclude there is a clear lack of research on physical layer optimisation targetting virtual reality applications' \ac{QoS} requirements.
