It shares many commonalities with more widely known \ac{VR} applications, ranging from gaming to real-state and retail applications. Thus, conclusions on how to optimise social \ac{XR} conferences would likely translate well on how to optimise other applications.

FROM THESIS STRUCTURE: 
Contributions - How does this work evolve the state of the art?
We have put together a framework for feasibility assessments and performance optimisation for indoors SXR applications that permits deriving deployment and configuration guidelines under various spectrum assignments;
We have filled the gaps in Modelling without which such framework would not be possible;
