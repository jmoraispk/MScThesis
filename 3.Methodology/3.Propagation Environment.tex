\section{Propagation Environment}
\label{sec:propagation_environment}

% I think it assumes 0 dBm transmitted power. Therefore we have to scale the coefficients accordingly, right?
Quadriga calculates the expected received power taking into account the path loss, the antenna patterns, the LoS polarisation and the antenna orientations.







The variation in orientation appears to play a more preponderant role than position change. This can be justified by the spatial consistency, i.e. similar propagation characteristics for similar spatial positions.
