% To reiterate, the difference between single-layer and multi-layer operation is the number of independent streams transmitted per \ac{UE}. In single-layer operation all antenna elements in the \acs{TX} and \acs{RX}'s arrays participate in the transmitting/receiving the data stream. In multi-layer operation, not necessarily every \acs{TX} and \acs{RX} antenna element participates in transmitting/receiving all data streams.
