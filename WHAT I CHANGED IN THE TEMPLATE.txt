1- Fixed author names dashes out if repeated. Now they can be repeated and won't be
dashed out.
2- Included [longest acronym] in the acronym list.
3- Figures path so that is possible to do:
\image{Intro/fig1.png}{descrip.}{label}{1}
Instead of:
\image{Figures/Intro/fig1.png}{descrip.}{label}{1}
4- replaced 'LE,RO' in page setup for 'C' for centred page numbers
5- Added '2 declaration.txt' to 'Inicio' folder and to tese.tex. 
6- Removed the inclusion of subfigure package. Outdated and conflicts with subcaption which is needed
to properly put figures side by side. (commented the packages.tex and in pagesetup.tex)
7- Added a myIEEEtran.bst to the file, such that this becomes agnostic to local files: 
it's a file that defines how the bibliography should look like. I fucking hate when the titles get all
modified in the bibliography, and a few other things. You may take the 'my' part out and check if you like
how your bibliography looks like. 
8- Got a new way of doing lists of symbols. The 00.symlist was just didn't work.

Extras:
1- Quite a few new macros, with support for more than 9 argument Macros.
2- \usepackage{enumitem} for different enumerates and 
	hyperlinked labels to each items.







TODO:

1- There are multiple gramatical errors in several comments. Read all comments and 
correct them. Take notes here what files were changed.
