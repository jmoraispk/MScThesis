\section{State of The Art}
\label{sec:int_state}

We go to mmWaves mainly in search of more spectrum.
In higher frequencies, the effective radiator decreases size and more antennas fit in the same form factor.
Using techniques such as beamforming, more antennas may also mean more spectral efficiency. 
With respect to the third factor of cell size, due to the increased attenuation of higher spectrum, cells will be unavoidably smaller.
Thus, higher densification goes from being an option to representing a need in mmWaves. \cite{sanguinetti2019massive}

% TODO: there's a very nice expression in the article above.
