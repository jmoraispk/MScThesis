Many contributed to this project. 

To my supervisors....

To Miguel Amador, the student that took the care of creating and documenting his \LaTeX thesis template and making it available for public use. To others like him, who strive to make their work ready to be used and built upon.

Remember, shoulders of giants?

What is the difference between this and acknowledgements? I've a good thank you there.
