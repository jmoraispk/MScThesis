Future work stuff here.


As mentioned in section X, such and such can be improved. One way is... Another way is... 



SU-MIMO SETTING:

Additionally, note the asymmetry between UL and DL that a single-layer transmission yields as the reception can be separate in polarisations and the received SINRs summed together.


% In case there are physical power limitations! Research is needed to see
% if this is the case of if we can distribute power more freely!
Power control: i) distribute the available power uniformly per layer, respecting the maximum available power per antenna element, and how many layers that antenna element is going to transmit; ii) scale down precoders with non-uniform amplitudes on the weights and that are causing power overflows in certain antennas; 


% use simulator to compare channel models too. 
% perhaps a ray tracing simulator is more realistic, since quadriga has difficulties simulating reflections from mmwaves
