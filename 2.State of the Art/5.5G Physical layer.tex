The length of the RB in time is called the Transmission Time Interval
(TTI). It is also considered to be the minimum division to perform operations. 

% Therefore, if transport block is lost, it will take the BS a couple of TTIs before re transmitting the information on that packet, making it more likely that the packet is dropped.


\begin{itemize}
    \item Spectrum allowed. 
\end{itemize}




Time it takes to obtain CSI: CSI delay = 4 TTIs
