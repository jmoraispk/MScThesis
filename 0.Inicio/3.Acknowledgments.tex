I would like to thank the Academy, bla bla bla..
\begin{comment}

%To Miguel Amador, for the Thesis Template. Also, more generally, to everyone that strives to transmit knowledge, share their work and allow their findings to be used as a base - to every professor, online lecturer, fellow colleague and everyone curious enough to go extensive lengths while worrying its work can be used by others and built upon.

My professor in Portugal, António Rodrigues, who helped unconditionally when it was needed, sometimes through the \ii{horse's door}, and allowed as much freedom as a student could wish for.

Since this marks the end of five years of studying, and I'm not planning on writing another of these any time soon, I should thank who shape my path along the way.
Some professors... Mário Silveirinha, António Topa, ...

And, fortunately, to too many friends to list, with whom I hope not to loose too much contact.



Concrete content contributions to this document:
- Maria for the MCS curves;
- Onno, Yohan, Manolis and Remco for the MIESM figure;
- 
- Remco for some figures;
- Remco and Sjors for reviewing;


HUGE thank you to TNO: invested in hardware necessary to deal with huge amounts of data, letting me using their Cloud for computations, ... and much more



% This is final:

To my advisory team in Hans, Remco and Sjors, for crucial reviews, for more than 50 meetings, more countless emails, and for any physical or virtual interaction. I always learned something. In particular Remco...

To the radio people. To other incredibly nice and no less important 


Niels, ... fortunately, way too many to count! There are more than about 90 people in the department. 

Among these people... Lucia ....

To Lucia (yes, again!), Eduardo, Mike, Dinho, Rosa and others that were the scarce but essential training partners I had during the pandemic.


To my good friends Afonso and Bernardo. For amazing talks that provided the perfect escape after long days. For accountability with the studies. For the countless rides back and forth when I could not walk. But especially for proving for more than ten years that real friendship does not look at gender, race or social class. Although we are all middle-class, white and male... This was a joke. Thanks for always reminding me of what fun is.

And to my parents. For always doing their best to give me everything I could need.
