I would like to thank the Academy, bla bla bla..

%To Miguel Amador, for the Thesis Template. Also, more generally, to everyone that strives to transmit knowledge, share their work and allow their findings to be used as a base - to every professor, online lecturer, fellow colleague and everyone curious enough to go extensive lengths while worrying its work can be used by others and built upon.

My professor in Portugal, António Rodrigues, who helped unconditionally, sometimes through the `horse's door', and allowed for a lot of freedom.

Since this marks the end of five years of studying, and I'm not planning on writing another of these any time soon, I should thank who shape my path along the way.
Some professors... Mário Silveirinha, António Topa, ...

And, fortunately, to too many friends to list, with whom I hope not to loose too much contact.
