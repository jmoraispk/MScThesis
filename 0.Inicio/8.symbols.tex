% IF there's time:
% MIGRATE THIS LIST OF SYMBOLS TO \newsym based! When the thesis is written, so we know where the first
% instance of the symbol is.

% \newsym{<description>}{<symbol>}
% from: https://personal.utdallas.edu/~kxh060100/symlist.pdf

% ONLY DO THIS if the 'dots between description and page number
% can be removed.

% It would also be nice to have different headings.




% RULE 1:
% NOTE ON THE MATHEMATICAL SYMBOLS TO USE
% As epsilon, use the first variant!

%\varepsilon for ε and \epsilon for ϵ
%\theta for θ and \vartheta for ϑ
%\pi for π and \varpi for or ϖ
%\rho for ρ and \varrho for ϱ
%\sigma for σ and \varsigma for ς
%\varphi for φ and \phi for ϕ

% Start of the list of Symbols
% have 3 lists: Sets, greek letters, normal letters


% RULE 2:
% All symbols are italic (subscripts and superscripts don't need to be)
% except matrices 

% \tab is given in the tabto package
\newcommand\mytab{\tab \hspace{-5cm}}

% If the box is not visually overfull, ignore the warning
% it has to do with the huge tab.
