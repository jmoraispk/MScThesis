The research presented in this document was conducted in TNO as part of ‘Empowered Edge’, a project in a first year research programme on Social-Extended Reality. As such, and much for the sorrow of the author, the codebase will not be made public as of the publication of this document.

This document presents most of the work developed over the course of a year. Also, it is a first attempt in creating a reliable and readable documentation of this project to facilitate its development in the years to come. 

%I did my best to explain everything clearly. Particular effort was placed in concepts not covered during my MSc degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Naturally, I needed to assume \hspace{-1mm}\ii{some}\hspace{-1mm} prior knowledge, and in those situations I have carefully selected proper references for adequate guidance.

%Given my inexperience with scientific writing, this work should be as easy to read as it was to produce. Nonetheless, the process did not lack enjoyment. Anyway, good luck!
