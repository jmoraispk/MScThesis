APPENDICES:
- put everything on parallelisation in an appendix
- put every complex deduction in an appendix:
	A framework for SINR computations:
	- say what a channel gain is;
	- say how to compute the received power from a UE;
	- say how to compute the interference in the UL and in the DL.


-> I'm okay with having a 40 page thesis with other 40 pages in appendices;


SYMBOLS & ABBREVIATIONS:

run a script of a ctrl + F that replaces every symbol and every abbreviation by the proper references.
E.g.

v -> \gls{v} 
TTI -> \ac{TTI}
TTIs -> \acs{TTI}
...




- Add pdfbookmarks to all chapters
