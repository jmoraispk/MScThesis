% Scenarios to consider




\subsection*{To predict bitrates for different bandwidth assignments}

% why is this usually not possible? only because of fading?


The bitrate achievable is basically directly proportional to the quantity of spectrum available. 
% due to channel hardening and flat fading, all frequency resources
% have basically the same fading, and the variation is only in path loss.

% estimate the path loss variation in a given band:
% delta PL = PL_lowest freq - PL_highest freq
% over 10, 20, 40 MHz, over 100, over 200, 400 and over 800 MHz
% for 3.5 and 26 GHz


% MEASURE SINR ACROSS THE PRBS!!!

Hence, we may simulate 40 MHz only and derive results for the any bandwidth.
