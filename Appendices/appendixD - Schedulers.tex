Without diving too deep in all the different variants of schedulers available out there, three are the most used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \ac{PF} scheduler - non-latency aware, maximises aggregated throughput and fairness across UEs. Expression in 
    
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:pf}
        
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}


as non-latency aware scheduler, the classical  ; ii) the \ac{M-LWDF} and \ac{EXP/PF}. The last two schedules are aware of the head-of-queue latency as well, and attribute higher priorities to queues/UEs that have packets to send/receive for longer.
