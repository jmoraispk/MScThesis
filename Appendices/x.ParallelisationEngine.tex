\section{Parallelisation Engine}
\label{sec:res_parallel_engine}

Two main results were derived from the implementation of the Parallelisation Engine and Python-Matlab interface. The first, and least interesting, regards the difference between Subprocesses and Threads.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ONE OF THE RESULTS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Subprocess vs Thread. 
Definition
Results of comparison.







%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SECOND RESULT %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The second, compares the quality of this engine, as compared to performing the parallelisation purely on Matlab, with the Parallel Computation toolbox.

%%%%%%%%
Compare building a parallelisation engine and doing the parallelisation in Matlab. Advantages and disadvantages...
